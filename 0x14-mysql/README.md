##  0x14. MySQL


#   0. Install MySQL

First things first, letâ€™s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.

*   MySQL distribution must be 5.7.x
*   Make sure that `task #3` of your SSH project is completed for `web-01` and `web-02`. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status
*   Please make sure you have your `README.md` pushed to GitHub.

Example:

```
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$ mysql --version
mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.25, for Linux (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$
```
