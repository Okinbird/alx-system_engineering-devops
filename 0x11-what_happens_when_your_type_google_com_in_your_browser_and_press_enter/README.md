0x11. What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter


You've probably seen it happen before. You open up a new tab in your browser and type in https://www.google.com. You hit enter, and suddenly you're staring at a blank screen. What's going on?

Don't worry, you're not the only one who's been curious about this. In fact, a lot of people have asked Google what happens when you type https://www.google.com into your browser and press enter. And as it turns out, there's a lot that happens behind the scenes when you do this.

Let me start from the user or client which is refered to you and I that tried to access the google page. The device you are using, either smartphone, laptop as long as it is connected to an internet is given a unique ip address by the Router. Think of the Router like your road network and the internet as the air field.

When it comes to web and its infrastructures, it is very deep, talking about the IP address alone can take a whole lot of time. Here I will just be taking a piece of the infrastructure and not make it complicated. Now as I was saying, the device you are using have a unique ip address. Remember computers only knows 1s and 0s. The https://www.google.com is just for human readability. That where the DNS server comes in, the https:// is just a protocol or URL, the www is the subdomain while the google.com is the domain name. Now DNS (Domain Name System) also have its own unique IP address. They help you to search for the real name of the domain google.com which is its IP address. I said they because, they are more than one jsut like a bunch of corellated devices working together in real time.
