##  **Web infrastructure design**

    Web infrastructure design can be refers to as building of LAMP stacks for a website that is hosts on a server and implementing the communication protocol, supporting structures for easy access between the clients and the servers.

#   **What is a server?**

    A server is a piece of computer program or device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". It helps to transfer data and other services to the "Clients" over the network. The word server comes from queueing theory dating back to the mid 20th, notably used by Kendall (1953) (along with "service"). Blade Server, Rack Server, Tower Servers are well known types of servers applied in data centers. Each of them is chosen as a solution for different application scenarios.
    Examples of servers are database servers (Oracle, MySQL), file servers , mail servers, print servers, web servers (Apache, Nginx), game servers, and application servers (Python).


#   **Domain Name**

    A domain name (often simply called a domain) is an easy-to-remember name that's associated with a physical IP address on the Internet. It's the unique name that appears after the @ sign in email addresses, and after www. in web addresses. It is formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Domain name roles are:
*   Domain names makes it easier to identify internet resources and memorize the numerical addresses used in the internet protocols.
*   It is also used to indicate ownership and establish unique identity for easy access.

#   **Domain Name System (DNS)**

    Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and distributed naming system used to locate computers or any resources connected to an IP-based network such as the internet or a private network. The DNS protocol is an important part of the web's infrastructure,serving as the internet's phone book: every time a user visit a website or performs a DNS lookup. It translates domain names (such as www.foobar.com) into the numerical IP addresses (such as 8.8.8.8) with the underlying network protocols needed by the user.
    The subdomain is a domain that is part of the main domain name such as the `www` in www.foobar.com, `foobar` is the primary domainand .com is the top level domain (TLD). 8.8.8.8 is the primary DNS server for Google DNS which is provided by Google for the public to make the Internet and the DNS system faster, safer, secure, and more reliable for all Internet users.
